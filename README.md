# Countdown

A simple command line countdown ending with an alarm

## Usage

* download the `countdown.py` script
* run it (to display a countdown for 25 minutes)

```bash
python3 countdown.py 25
```

Use the `-a` switch to set an alarm at the end: assuming that `xcalib` is installed on your computer, the `-a` switch will invert the color of your screen.  It's time for a break!

To restore the screen colors, press Enter.

You can pause the countdown by pressing Ctrl+C.  Press Enter to resume, or Ctrl+C again to stop the countdown.
